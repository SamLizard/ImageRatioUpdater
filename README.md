# ImageRatioUpdater
The program adds transparent pixels to the image borders in order to make it compatible with standard ratios.

### Compatibility
The Script is only compatible with macOS.

### How to use it
To run the script on one image, update IMAGE_NAME, IMAGE_EXTENSION and FOLDER_PATH to your image personal settings.

By default, the output image will be saved in the Downloads folder.

To run the script on a folder full of images, update FOLDER_PATH.

The output images will be saved by default in a folder named "Standard ratio images" inside the folder that stocked the initial images.

### Use case
To share images, sometimes it is required to give a standard ratio image. For example, in instagram, when publishing a post, the image has to be in a ratio : 4:5 ; 1:1 or 16:9 (up to 1.91:1). If the image is not in the compatible ratio, it will be cropped (instead of having transparent pixels at the borders).

## Examples

The program take in input the image:
