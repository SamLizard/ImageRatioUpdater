# ImageRatioUpdater
The program adds transparent pixels to the image borders in order to make it compatible with standard ratios.

### Compatibility
The Script is only compatible with macos.

### How to use it
To run the script on one image, update IMAGE_NAME, IMAGE_EXTENSION and FOLDER_PATH to your image personal settings.

By default, the output image will be saved in the Downloads folder.

To run the script on a folder full of images, update FOLDER_PATH (and optionally, change IMAGE_EXTENSION - pay attention: the extentions of all your images have to be the same).

The output images will be saved by default in a folder named "Standard ratio images" inside the folder that stocked the initial images.

## Examples

The program take in input the image:
